## Functions
> Modularize: split a complex problem into simple mini problems.

- Make it possible to **modularize** a program
- Return's data **type specified** before their name.

Syntax:
```
type name(parameters) {
    return
}
```

### Local Variables
Variables happen to be local if they're **declared within the function statements/parameters** therefore their availability is exclusive and limited to the function's domain.
